## Comparing between deterministic and stochastic modeling - simple growth modeling 

Consider the modeling of the size of a population at time $t$, let's call this quantity $x(t),$ and suppose we have the following assumptions:

- there are no deaths in the population
- there are no interactions between individuals
- each individual has the same birth rate $b$
- at time $t = 0,$ the population is $a > 0$

### Deterministic formulation:

We can model $x(t)$ by modeling it's rate of change, as a function of itself:

$\frac{dx}{dt} = bx,x_0 = x(0) = a$ 

$\int dx(t) = \int bx(t) dt$

The only function that satisfy the above relation is if $x(t) = e^{bt}.$ Therefore:

$x = a e^{bt},$ where $a > 0 $ = initial population, $x(0)$, and $b > 0$ = birth rate

Below is a visualization of the population over time with some assumption for $a$ and $b$: 

```{r det_model}




```


### Stochastic formulation:

In the stochastic case, we are interested in the _*Probability*_ that our population at time $t$ is at a some quantity. Mathematically, that is defined as \[p_n(t) = \mathbb{P}(x(t)=n).\] 

THis means that, instead of modeling $\frac{dx}{dt}$, the rate of change of the population, we model the rate of change of the probability, $\frac{dp_n(t)}{dt},$ and our goal here is to solve for $p_n(t)$.

One approach is the assumption that the population equations $n$ at time $t + \Delta t$ is a one of these two events:

- at time $t$ the population size was $n - 1$ and there was a birth
- at time $t$ the population size was $n$ and there was no birth

which can be formulated as :


\[
p_n(t+\Delta t) = \underbrace{p_{n-1}(t)}_{\text{prob. that size} = n-1}\overbrace{b(n-1)\Delta t}^{\text{new birth}} + \underbrace{p_n(t)}_{\text{prob. that size = n}}\overbrace{(1 - b n \Delta t)}^{\text{ no new birth}}
\]

subtracting $p_n(t)$ from both side,  divide by $\Delta t$ and letting $\Delta t \to 0,$ we get the following differential equation:


\[
\frac{p_n(t)}{dt} = b(n-1)p_{n-1}(t) - bnp_n(t)
\]

where $n = 1, 2, \dots$. It turns out, at each fixed time $t$, $p_n(t)$ follows the negative binomial distribution with the following parameters:


\[
p_n(t) = {n-1 \choose {a-1}} e^{-abt} (1=e^{-bt})^{n-a}, n = a, a+1, a+2, \dots\]



Now, to simulate a sample path based on the above assumption, we need to know the distribution of the time between successive birth events, or its _interenvet_ time. It turns out in the case of a simple birth process (Stochastic counterpart of exponential growht model), the interevent time is _exponentially distributed_ with rate $bn.$ In other words, if $T$ represents the time it takes to go from one birth event to next, then $T$ is a random variable with a distribution that satisfies:\[\mathbb{P}(T>t) = \exp(-bnt), t > 0\]


```{r stoch_mode}

# define negative binomial distribution with shift a:



stoch_time <- function(n, b){
  st <- rep(0,length(n))
  
  for (i in 1: (length(n)-1)){
    
    st[i+1] <- st[i] - log(runif(1))/(b*n[i])
  }
  return(st)
}





```




### Example 2: Random Walk

- Suppose you have some change (`$k`) and you’d like to see if you could get to `$n` by betting with a friend on a coin toss.

- Each time you flip a coin dictates whether or not you’re gain $1, or lose $1.
 
Let $X_i, i = 1,2, 3,...$ be such an event. Note that $\{𝑋_𝑖\}_{i=1}^\infty$  is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and 

- $𝑋_𝑖= +1$  with probability p
- $𝑋_𝑖=−1$  with probability q = 1-p

Now suppose $𝑆_𝑛=𝑋_1+𝑋_2+⋯+𝑋_𝑛$ is the amount of dollars you have left after n turns. You will not stop until you either get $n or lost all your change.

*What is $\mathbb{P}(S_n = 0)$?*


Let's define some functions to help us find the answer by simulation.

```{r gamble}




```


Now let's give this a try. Suppose we have a budget of k = $10, and we'd like to play this game 40 times (or until we lost all fortune, or until we got \$40, whichever comes first).

Let's simulate this game 1000 times (i.e. assume we're robots that never gets tired of flipping coins, or losing money)

```{r}

# simulate probability of P(Sn = 0)

# Estimate of probability that gambler is ruined
# For p = 0.5, exact probability is (n-k)/n


# simulate sample paths of random walks after n steps:


```



Let's try to simulate $S_n$ as a function of n:

```{r Sn}


# simulate gambler's sum as a function of n:


```
