## Example of a counting process
Suppose $T_k, k =0,1,2,...$  are i.i.d. exponential random variables, and we observe:
\[T_1 =2, T_2 = 1, T_3 = 1/2, T_4 =3, T_5 = 4\]

Graph the counting process $N(t) for which these are the interarrival times for $0\leq t\leq 10.

```{r}


#assign inter-arrival time
t_list<-c(2,1,0.5,3,4)

# set number of arrivals
n<-length(t_list)

# initiate total wait time 
s_list <-numeric(n)

# assign cumulative wait time for each event:
for (i in 1:n){
  
  s_list[i]<- sum(t_list[1:i])
  print(s_list)
}

# plot function:
plot(stepfun(s_list[1:(n)],0:(n)), 
     do.points = TRUE,
     pch = 16,
     col.points = "red",
     verticals = FALSE,
     main = 'Realization of a Poisson process',
     xlab = 'Time of arrival',
     ylab = 'Number of arrivals')
```
